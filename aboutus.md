## About Us

Established over 60 years ago, in 1951, by Dr. N. Ramanathan, one of the earliest touch-bearers of scientific medicine in the district of Thanjavur, the hospital began humbly as a small but an efficient home for the healing. In fact the building in which the nursing home is a part of, is called ‘Visranthi’, literally translating into ‘a peaceful abode’. In those early days, the hospital started with ten separate rooms, and one VIP suite for patients. One of the unique features was individual kitchens for each patients where their caretakers could prepare their own food.

Over the years, the establishment has undergone a number of transformations. Although the functional concepts of old days have lost their edge, the hospital retains the core paradigm of medicine and healthcare in all its new endeavors – ‘a holistic and familial approach’. This rather old idea, has been getting lot of renewed attention and focus in the current era of cutting-edge, efficient medicine where the personal, family-centric care has gone amiss. We at Ramanathan Hospital, are proud to say that we continue to uphold that tradition at the same time, continue our pursuit of scientific, evidence-based medicine.

Medical care is headed by Senior General Physician, Dr. R. Kumar, son of the founder, with over thirty five years of practice to his credit. Dr. R. Kumar has made a name for himself as the Physician for the masses, more specifically, for the poor and underprivileged. He is the recipient of *‘Annal Gandhi Adigal Award’* for his exemplary service in healthcare.

We have a diabetic & thyroid centre that caters to all strata of society with facilities for early detection, treatment alongside patient education. Embracing modern medicine with traditional values at our core, we strive to provide a high quality, affordable healthcare to the people.

 A fully-modern Dental polyclinic facility has been running within our premises for the past few years with Consultants visiting from the state capital, Chennai. This new facility is headed by Dr. A. Usha, one of the most established dentists in town. Please explore our services section for full details.
