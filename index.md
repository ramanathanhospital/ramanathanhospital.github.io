Ramanathan Hospital is one of the oldest private nursing homes in Thanjavur city, established in *1951*. Our founder Dr. N. Ramanathan was a pioneer in patient centred medical care and developed quite a successful practice in the City and its surrounding areas. He then went on to build a patient-centred medical home (PCMH) that is now our present premises.The concept of PCMH is thoroughly modern in primary care and didn’t quite exist in his times. Which is why, his approach to patient care never ceases to amaze us till today.

He emphasized on the primacy of the patient over anything else and he strongly believed in the well-being of ‘whole person’ than in the treatment of a particular ‘case’.

Our values are based on his foundation and naturally, we are quite proud of it.
